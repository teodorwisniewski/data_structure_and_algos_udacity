## Introduction

We have five tasks to do. Once it is done, we want to calculate Big 0 of the run time for each task.


## Task 0 - run time analysis (Worst Case Big-O Notation)
We used two print statements for our solution. No loop is used. Thus, we can approximate run time with Big O(const),
which can be further simplified to O(n).


## Task 1 - run time analysis (Worst Case Big-O Notation)
We used 2 loops that are not nested. Thus, we can approximate run time with Big O(2n + const),
which can be further simplified to O(n).

## Task 2 - run time analysis (Worst Case Big-O Notation)
We used one loop. Thus, we can approximate run time with Big O(n + const),
which can be further simplified to O(n).

## Task 3 - run time analysis (Worst Case Big-O Notation)
We used five loops that were not nested. Thus, we can approximate run time with Big O(5n+const),
which can be further simplified to O(n).

## Task 4 - run time analysis (Worst Case Big-O Notation)
We used three loops that were not nested. Thus, we can approximate run time with Big O(3n+const),
which can be further simplified to O(n).
