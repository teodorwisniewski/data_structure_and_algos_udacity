We have five tasks to do. Once it is done, we want to calculate Big 0 of the run time for each task.

TASK 0
We used two print statements for our solution. No loop is used. Thus, we can approximate run time with Big O(const),
which can be further simplified to O(n).

TASK 1
We used 2 loops that are not nested. Thus, we can approximate run time with Big O(2n + const), which can be further simplified to O(n).

TASK 2
We used one loop. Thus, we can approximate run time with Big O(n + const), which can be further simplified to O(n).

TASK3
We used five loops that were not nested. Thus, we can approximate run time with Big O(5n+const), which can be further simplified to O(n).

TASK4:
We used three loops that were not nested. Thus, we can approximate run time with Big O(3n+const), which can be further simplified to O(n).
